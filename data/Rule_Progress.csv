RIN 3235-AL76","Pursuant to Section 764(a) of Title VII of the DFA, SEC Proposed Rule of Practice 194 would provide a process for a registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant (collectively, “SBS Entity”) to make an application to the SEC for an order permitting an associated person who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. Proposed Rule of Practice 194 also would exclude an SBS Entity, subject to certain limitations, from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated persons that are not natural persons (i) for a period of 30 days following the associated person becoming subject to a statutory disqualification or 30 days following the person that is subject to a statutory disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity; (ii) for a period of 180 days following the filing of a complete application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and notice if the application and notice are filed within the same 30-day time period; and (iii) for a period of 180 days following the filing of a complete application with, or initiation of a process by, the CFTC, a SRO or a registered futures association pending a final decision with respect to an application or process with respect to the associated person for the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, where the application has been filed or process started prior to or within the same 30- day time period and a notice has been filed with the SEC within the same 30-day time period. The proposed Rule of Practice 194 also would provide, in certain circumstances, for an extension of the temporary exclusion from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated persons that are not natural persons to comply with the prohibition in Section 15F(b)(6). Finally, proposed Rule of Practice 194 would provide that, subject to certain conditions, an SBS Entity may permit an associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, without making an application pursuant to the proposed rule, where the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief from a statutory disqualification with respect to that associated person.","2015/10/26 - Comment Deadline for Proposed Rule

RIN 7100 AE-26","The Federal Reserve Board is inviting public comment on a framework to establish risk-based capital surcharges for the largest, most interconnected U.S.-based bank holding companies pursuant to section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposal is based upon the international standard adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, modified to reflect systemic risk concerns specific to the funding structures of large U.S. bank holding companies.
The proposed framework would require a U.S. top-tier bank holding company with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to calculate a measure of its systemic importance and would identify a subset of those companies as global systemically important bank holding companies based on that measure. A global systemically important bank holding company would be subject to a risk-based capital surcharge that would increase its capital conservation buffer under the Board's regulatory capital rule. The proposed framework would be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 through year-end 2018, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. The proposal would also revise the terminology used to identify the firms subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards to ensure consistency of the scopes of application of both rulemakings.","2016/05/13 - Comment Deadline for Proposed Amendment to Proposed Rule

The requirement is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of internationally active banking organizations, thereby improving the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, as well as improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The proposed rule would apply to all internationally active banking organizations, generally, bank holding companies, certain savings and loan holding companies, and depository institutions with more than $250 billion in total assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed rule would also apply to companies designated for supervision by the FSOC under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act that do not have significant insurance operations and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The Fed also is proposing on its own a modified liquidity coverage ratio standard that is based on a 21-calendar day stress scenario rather than a 30-calendar day stress scenario for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies without significant insurance or commercial operations that, in each case, have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.","2015/01/01 - Effective Date of Final Rule

The proposed NSFR requirement is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization’s regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, as well as to promote improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The proposed rule would also amend certain definitions in the liquidity coverage ratio rule that are also applicable to the NSFR. The proposed NSFR requirement would apply beginning on January 1, 2018, to bank holding companies, certain savings and loan holding companies, and depository institutions that, in each case, have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. In addition, the Board is proposing a modified NSFR requirement for bank holding companies and certain savings and loan holding companies that, in each case, have $50 billion or more, but less than $250 billion, in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. Neither the proposed NSFR requirement nor the proposed modified NSFR requirement would apply to banking organizations with consolidated assets of less than $50 billion and total on-balance sheet foreign exposure of less than $10 billion. A bank holding company or savings and loan holding company subject to the proposed NSFR requirement or modified NSFR requirement would be required to publicly disclose the company’s NSFR and the components of its NSFR each calendar quarter.","2016/08/05 - Comment Deadline for Proposed Rule

Under the proposed rule, any U.S. top-tier bank holding company identified by the Board as a global systemically important banking organization (GSIB), the subsidiaries of any U.S. GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations), and the U.S. operations of any foreign GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations) would be subjected to restrictions regarding the terms of their non-cleared qualified financial contracts (QFCs). First, a covered entity would generally be required to ensure that QFCs to which it is party, including QFCs entered into outside the United States, provide that any default rights and restrictions on the transfer of the QFCs are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Second, a covered entity would generally be prohibited from being party to QFCs that would allow a QFC counterparty to exercise default rights against the covered entity based on the entry into a resolution proceeding under the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any other resolution proceeding of an affiliate of the covered entity. The proposal would also amend certain definitions in the Board’s capital and liquidity rules; these amendments are intended to ensure that the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of QFCs to which a covered entity is party is not affected by the proposed restrictions on such QFCs.

The final rule applies to any U.S. top-tier bank holding company (BHC) with more than $700 billion in total consolidated assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody and any insured depository institution subsidiary of these BHCs. In the revised capital regulations adopted by the agencies in July 2013, the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent, consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for banking organizations subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. The final rule establishes enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for covered BHCs and their subsidiary IDIs. Under the final rule, an IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 6 percent to be well capitalized under the agencies' prompt corrective action framework. The Fed also is adopting in the final rule a supplementary leverage ratio buffer for covered BHCs of 2 percent above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent. The leverage buffer functions like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital rule. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure is not subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the final rule. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the agencies are proposing changes to the 2013 revised capital rule's supplementary leverage ratio, including changes to the definition of total leverage exposure, which would apply to all advanced approaches banking organizations and thus, if adopted, would affect banking organizations subject to this final rule.","2018/01/01 - Effective Date of Final Rule

The final rule consolidates three separate notices of proposed rulemaking that the OCC, Fed, and FDIC published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2012, with selected changes. The final rule implements a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator. The final rule incorporates these new requirements into the agencies' prompt corrective action framework. In addition, the final rule establishes limits on a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Further, the final rule amends the methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for all banking organizations, and introduces disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets. The final rule also adopts changes to the agencies' regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of Section 171 and Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The CFTC proposes to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and option contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are ""economically equivalent"" to such contracts (as such term is used in section 4a(a)(5) of the CEA). In connection with establishing these limits, the CFTC proposes to update some relevant definitions; revise the exemptions from speculative position limits, including for bona fide hedging; and extend and update reporting requirements for persons claiming exemption from these limits. The CFTC proposes appendices to revised part 150 that would (i) provide guidance on risk management exemptions for commodity derivatives contracts in excluded commodities permitted under the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; (ii) list core referenced futures contracts and commodities that would be substantially the same as a commodity underlying a core referenced futures contract for purposes of the proposed definition of basis contract; (iii) describe and analyze fourteen fact patterns that would satisfy the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; and (iv) present the proposed speculative position limit levels in tabular form. In addition, the CFTC proposes to update certain of its rules, guidance and acceptable practices for compliance with DCM core principle 5 and SEF core principle 6 in respect of exchange-set speculative position limits and position accountabilitly levels.","2016/07/13 - Comment Deadline for Proposed Rule

Under the Act, funds in the Civil Penalty Fund may be used for payments to the victims of activities for which civil penalties have been imposed under Federal consumer financial laws. In addition, to the extent that such victims cannot be located or such payments are otherwise not practicable, the CFPB may use funds in the Civil Penalty Fund for the purpose of consumer education and financial literacy programs. This proposal is related to a final rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. That final rule implements the statutory Civil Penalty Fund provisions by articulating the CFPB's interpretation of what kinds of payments to victims are appropriate and by establishing procedures for allocating funds for such payments to victims and for consumer education and financial literacy programs.

The proposal generally would cover two categories of loans. First, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term of 45 days or less. Second, the proposal generally would cover loans with a term greater than 45 days, provided that they (1) have an all-in annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent; and (2) either are repaid directly from the consumer’s account or income or are secured by the consumer’s vehicle. For both categories of covered loans, the proposal would identify it as an abusive and unfair practice for a lender to make a covered loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal generally would require that, before making a covered loan, a lender must reasonably determine that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan. The proposal also would impose certain restrictions on making covered loans when a consumer has or recently had certain outstanding loans. The proposal would provide lenders with options to make covered loans without satisfying the ability-to-repay requirements, if those loans meet certain conditions. The proposal also would identify it as an unfair and abusive practice to attempt to withdraw payment from a consumer’s account for a covered loan after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer’s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The proposal would require lenders to provide certain notices to the consumer before attempting to withdraw payment for a covered loan from the consumer’s account. The proposal would also prescribe processes and criteria for registration of information systems, and requirements for furnishing loan information to and obtaining consumer reports from those registered information systems.

It would also include automobile leases and purchases or acquisition of such automobile lease agreements.

RIN 3170-AA33","The CFPB is amending subpart B of Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and the official interpretation to the regulation. This final rule (the 2013 Final Rule) modifies the final rules issued by the CFPB in February, July, and August 2012 (collectively the 2012 Final Rule) that implement section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding remittance transfers. The amendments address three specific issues. First, the 2013 Final Rule modifies the 2012 Final Rule to make optional, in certain circumstances, the requirement to disclose fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution. Second and relatedly, the 2013 Final Rule also makes optional the requirement to disclose taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. In place of these two former requirements, the 2013 Final Rule requires disclaimers to be added to the rule's disclosures indicating that the recipient may receive less than the disclosed total due to the fees and taxes for which disclosure is now optional. Finally, the 2013 Final Rule revises the error resolution provisions that apply when a remittance transfer is not delivered to a designated recipient because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, and, in particular, when a sender provides an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier that results in the transferred funds being deposited in the wrong account.","2013/10/28 - Effective Date of Final Rules

The Board is requesting comment on two alternative frameworks for return requirements. Under Alternative 1, the expeditious-return requirement currently imposed on paying banks and returning banks for returned checks would be eliminated; a paying bank returning a check would be required to provide the depositary bank with a notice of nonpayment of the check - regardless of the amount of the check being returned - only if the paying bank sends the returned check in paper form. Under Alternative 2, the current expeditious-return requirement - using the current two-day test - would be retained for checks being returned to a depositary bank electronically via another bank, but the notice-of-nonpayment requirement would be eliminated. The Board is proposing to retain, without change, the regulation's current same-day settlement rule for paper checks.

Section 129C authorizes the agency with responsibility for compliance with TILA, which is CFPB, to issue a rule implementing these requirements, and the CFPB has issued its rule implementing these requirements.

Specifically, this final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act sections addressing servicers' obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; to provide certain information requested by such borrowers; and to provide protections to such borrowers in connection with force-placed insurance. Additionally, this final rule addresses servicers' obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures to achieve certain delineated objectives; to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; to establish policies and procedures for providing delinquent borrowers with continuity of contact with servicer personnel capable of performing certain functions; and to evaluate borrowers' applications for available loss mitigation options. Further, this final rule modifies and streamlines certain existing servicing-related provisions of Regulation X. For instance, this final rule revises provisions relating to a mortgage servicers' obligation to provide disclosures to borrowers in connection with transfers of mortgage servicing, and a mortgage servicers' obligation to manage escrow accounts, including restrictions on purchasing force-placed insurance for certain borrowers with escrow accounts and requirements to return amounts in an escrow account to a borrower upon payment in full of a mortgage loan.
