                                                  There were a number of consumer protections provided by the CARD
                                                  Act that do not apply to small business cards. These include:
                                                         Penalty Fee Restrictions: penalty fees have to be “reasonable and
                                                         proportional” to the relevant violation of account terms. In general,
                                                         penalty fees for consumers should be restricted to $25 for a ﬁrst late
                                                         payment and $35 for each subsequent late payment.
                                                         Overlimit Fee Opt-In: issuers can only charge an overlimit fee if the
                                                         customer opts in to overdraft protection.
                                                         Payment timing: Payments must be due on the same day of every
                                                         month, reducing the risk of confusion.
                                                         Payment Allocation: When the payment amount exceeds the
                                                         minimum due, issuers generally need to apply the amount above the
                                                         minimum due to the balances with the highest interest rates ﬁrst.
                                                         Monthly Statements: The statement needs to show how long it would
                                                         take, and how much it would cost, to pay off the debt if only the
                                                         minimum due is made. In addition, the statement needs to show the
                                                         payment required in order to pay off the balance in three years.
                                                         Ability to pay: Card issuers cannot open a credit card or increase a
                                                         credit line unless the ability of the consumer to repay is taken into
                                                         account.
                                                  All of the protections listed above are required for consumer credit cards,
                                                  but are not required for small business cards.
                                                  In many cases, credit card issuers have decided voluntarily to provide some
                                                  of these protections to consumers. However, it is important to understand
                                                  that these protections, when provided, are at the discretion of the bank
                                                  and can be removed.
                                                  Small Business Credit Cards Can Still Provide A
                                                  Valuable Service
                                                  When used properly, a small business credit card can still provide excellent
                                                  value. Here are some of the beneﬁts:
                                                         Small business credit cards can be a great way to manage
                                                         discretionary expenses, particularly when combined with services like
                                                         Expensify (https://www.expensify.com/) and integrated with
                                                         QuickBooks (http://quickbooks.intuit.com/). T&E, travel and other
                                                         expenses can quickly get out of hand, and creating electronic records
                                                         of every transaction can help the budgeting and management
                                                         process.
                                                         A small business credit card is a free line of credit if you pay the
                                                         balance in full and on time every month. In effect, you are being given
                                                         a free working capital line of credit. For example, if you use Google
                                                         AdWords to acquire customers, you can get 20 – 25 days (depending
                                                         upon the length of the grace period) before you have to pay the bill.
                                                         This can be very helpful for cash management purposes.
                                                         For short-term borrowing needs (for example, 30 days), a small
                                                         business credit card could be the least bad option. Imagine you need
                                                         to borrow $15,000 for 2 months until you get paid for a job. At an 18%
                                                         interest rate, it would cost you about $450 of interest to borrow the

Shame on First Premier Bank: You get an F - MagnifyMoney                                                                                 8/8/16, 5:49 PM
                                                        money for two months. That is a lot cheaper than most merchant
                                                        advance businesses, which have interest rates well above 40%.
                                                        You have the potential to earn rewards. It is easy to earn at least 2%
                                                        on your spending, which can be serious money depending upon the
                                                        spending needs of your business.
                                                        The debt associated with your small business will not appear on your
                                                        personal credit report so long as you remain current, which can help
                                                        keep your credit score up.
                                                        One of the greatest accounting risks faced by small businesses is that
                                                        they co-mingle their personal and business accounts. By using a
                                                        separate card, you can ensure you don’t mix up your personal and
                                                        business expenses.
                                                  Just remember – if you have a longer term borrowing need, it is better to go
                                                  through the process of applying for a term loan. Although the process will
                                                  take a bit longer, you should be able to get a much lower, ﬁxed interest
                                                  rate.
