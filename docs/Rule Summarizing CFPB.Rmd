```

This overviews summarizing rules using the TextRank R package, which is an application of the Google PageRank algorithm to sentences. The paper behind the package is available [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf). Keywords are extracted from each sentence and a weighted graph is built estimating connected sentences. As a proof of concept, I've applied it to a (relatively) straightforward case. The rule is "Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans," a CFPB final rule from 2020, available (here)[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/22/2020-14935/payday-vehicle-title-and-certain-high-cost-installment-loans#p-123]. 

After tweaking the inputs iteratively, it looks like this may be an effective tool to summarize rules. A suggestion would be to apply it over single documents (such as comments) to get quick results and over sections of very long rules. Running this on a rule like the Volker Rule without reasoned subsetting would be difficult, as it constructs a Jaccard index in approximately $O(n^2)$ time where n is the number of sentences. For this example, it takes approximately 30 seconds to run from download to summary on 179 sentences.

Below is an overview of the process:

First, load a basic set of libraries, nothing too extraordinary.
```{r libs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(textrank)
library(xml2)
library(tidytext)
library(magrittr)
```



Then, download the rule. This could equivalently be used by loading a comment from file, but with slightly different processing.
```{r Gather Data}
#XML link to rule
link <- 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2020/07/22/2020-14935.xml'

  xml_rule_text <- . %>% 
    read_xml() %>% 
    xml_children() %>% 
    xml_children() %>%
    xml_text() %>% 
    str_squish() %>% 
    tibble::enframe(value = "text",  name = "id") %>% 
    mutate(id = str_pad(id, 4, pad = "0") )
  
text <- xml_rule_text(link)
```

Next, we need to process the text of the rule. Steps include:
1. Remove blank strings.
2. Identify if the first character is a number to avoid including footnotes.
3. Identify headings to avoid useless information (such as "I. Background") for computational purposes.
4. Identify the text before the actual rule to avoid the summary and people's names.
5. Remove all numbers, as they trick the algorithm too much.

```{r Prep Data}

# split out sections
section <- . %>% 
  mutate(section = text %>% str_extract("^SUMMARY:|^([A-Z]*\\.|[1-9]\\.).*") %>% 
           str_sub(1,80) ) %>% 
  tidyr::fill(section, .direction = "down") %>%
  mutate( section = ifelse( nchar(section) == 80, 
                           str_c(section, "..."), 
                           section) )

# clean up (must be done after sectioning because it removes section numbers)
clean <- . %>%  
  filter(nchar(text) > 60) %>% 
  # identify headings as lines with a period in the beginning (also captures some footnotes)
  mutate(part = ifelse(str_detect(str_sub(text, 1, 5) ,'\\.'), 'head', 'text')) %>% 
  # idetify footnotes with a number and no period
  mutate(part = ifelse(text %>% str_detect("^[0-9](?!\\.)"), 'footnote', part) ) %>% 
  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, "\\(.\\)|[0-9]|_")) %>%
  filter(text != "") %>% #filter out blank strings
  mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, "ยง"))

# consider using this clean function instead of the last three lines. https://github.com/judgelord/rulemaking/blob/master/functions/clean_string.R

text  %<>% section() %>% clean() 
```
              
Once we've cleaned the text, we need to extract the sentences and words, using tidytext.    
```{r tokenize}
summarizeText <- function(sections, text, max_sentences) {
  
  sentences <- text %>%
    filter(section == sections) %>%
    select(text) %>%
    unnest_sentences(output = sentences, input = text) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    mutate(textrank_id = row_number()) %>% 
    # textrank requires columns in order
    select(textrank_id, sentences)

  # select max sentences per section
  sentences %<>% filter(textrank_id <= max_sentences)

  words <- unnest_tokens(sentences, output = word, input = 'sentences') %>% 
    distinct() %>% 
    anti_join(tidytext::stop_words)
  
  if(nrow(sentences) > 1){
out <- textrank::textrank_sentences(data = sentences, 
                                    terminology = words)
  } else {
    out <- list(sentences = as.data.frame(sentences))
  }

return(out)

}

summarize_sections <- function(text, n_sentences, max_sentences) {

  # section and clean text 
  text %<>% section() %>% clean() %>% 
    filter(!is.na(section), part == "text") %>%
    #FIXME make max_sentences depend on section length
    # group_by(section) %>% 
    add_count(section, name = "section_length") 
  
  # summarize 
  text_summary <-  map(.x = text$section %>% unique() , 
                         .f = summarizeText, 
                         text = text, 
                         max_sentences = max_sentences) 
  
  # extract top sentences
  pull_sentences <- . %>% 
    .$sentences %>% 
    pull(sentence) %>% 
    .[1:n_sentences] %>% 
    str_to_sentence() %>%  
    str_c(collapse = " ")
  
  section_summary <- tibble(
    section = pull(text, section) %>% unique(), 
    summary = text_summary %>% map_chr(possibly(pull_sentences, otherwise = " ") ) ) 
  
  return(section_summary)
}

# apply function to text 
summary <- summarize_sections(text, 
                              n_sentences = 2,
                              max_sentences = 50)

summary %>%   knitr::kable()

```
